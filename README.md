# Python-Reading-and-Filtering-Nested-JSON-Dataset

In this notebook, we will see how to read nested JOSN file, and then how to filter that loaded dataset under different conditions.

A JSON file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. It is primarily used for transmitting data between a web application and a server. Most of the JSON files are nested and we cannot directly import them into a dataframe. We first need to clean and filter the json file in order to convert it into a dataframe.
